## Well Generation Algorithm V2
In this version the pumping will be distributed according to the CVHM pumping that is showing in the figure. In CVHM there are two types of wells. Multi node and farm wells. The amount of water pumped from each cell at every stress is provided at the end of the simulation in the cell by cell flow output file. In our analysis we average the pumping for the period between October 1977 and February 2003. To make a distinction between pumped water used for Urban ang agriculture we overlay the pumping distribution map to the 200 land use map. Finally 84% of the pumped water was estimated that is used for agricultural  and 16% for urban uses. The ratio between Ag and urban water use is shown for each farm as piechart below.
