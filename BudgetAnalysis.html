<h1>Groundwater budget analysis</h1>
    <p>
    A basic assumption of the NPSAT approach is that the flow is steady state. 
    To derive a representative steady state solution it is important that the storage change is approximately 0.<br/>
    The following plot below shows the monthly and yearly cumulative storage change based on the 
    <a href="https://ca.water.usgs.gov/projects/central-valley/central-valley-hydrologic-model.html">CVHM</a> and 
    <a href="https://water.ca.gov/Library/Modeling-and-Analysis/Central-Valley-models-and-tools/C2VSim">C2Vsim</a> hydrologic models.<br/>
        
    Overall there is a significant decline in storage, however there are few periods where the storage change is very close to 0.<br/>
    According to the CVHM, the longest recent period with zero storage change spans 21 years from <b>12/1977</b> to <b>4/1999</b>, where the storage has been declined 35.5 mACFT with respect to initial conditions. <br/> However, the most recent period spans 11 years from <b>12/1991</b> to <b>9/2003</b>. <br/>
    According to C2Vsim there is only one relatively long period with negligible storage change between <b>10/1992</b> and <b>4/2007</b>.

    <h1>Calculation of Steady state flows</h1>
    <p>
        For each of the two selected periods we will calculate the average flows that will be used as steady state conditions during the simulation.
